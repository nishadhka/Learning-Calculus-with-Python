    "# Stegotons: solitary waves arising in non-dispersive periodic media\n",
    "A fascinating new class of solitary waves was discovered in [a 2003 paper by R.J. LeVeque and D. Yong](http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pubs/solitary/40815.pdf).  Solitary waves usually appear as solutions of nonlinear dispersive wave equations, like the KdV or NLS equations.  But the waves discovered by LeVeque and Yong arise in a system of nonlinear wave equations **with no dispersion!**  The nonlinear elasticity equations they investigated are:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\epsilon_t(x,t) - u_x(x,t) & = 0 \\\\\n",
    "(\\rho(x) u(x,t))_t - \\sigma(\\epsilon(x,t),x)_x & = 0.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "They took the density $\\rho(x)$ and bulk modulus $K(x)$ to be periodic functions and the stress strain relation $\\sigma(\\epsilon,x)$ nonlinear (they used an exponential function, but any nonlinear function will work).\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\rho$ and $K$ are chosen so that the impedance $Z = \\sqrt{\\rho K}$ varies in space, then waves undergo reflection on the fine scale.  Remarkably, the effect of these reflections is an effective behavior that mimics dispersion -- as [predicted already by Santosa & Symes in 1993](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0151049).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we reproduce some of their original experiments in PyClaw.  If you're interested in the simulations, all of the code is provided here and you can run it yourself.  If you're only interested in the results, feel free to just skip over the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also shows how to plot PyClaw results with Bokeh, to get plots that can easily be zoomed and panned."

    "## Making the simulation more efficient with a custom boundary condition and a before_step function\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that the initial pulse is breaking up into a train of waves, but we'd like to study their behavior over longer periods of time, when the solitary waves separate completely.  A nice trick for this purpose is to use a periodic domain and let the waves travel around it several times, thus avoiding the need for a huge computational domain.  This works well as long as the leading waves don't catch up with the tail.  Also, it's enough to examine one of the two wave trains (say, the right-going one).  Indeed, in our periodic domain, the left- and right-going trains would interact, so we'll want to eliminate one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, we'll add two advanced features to our simulation code.  First, we'll implement a custom boundary condition at the left edge, corresponding to an oscillating wall, that will only generate a right-going wave.  Second, we'll add a `before_step()` function.  `before_step` is a hook to do anything special that needs to occur at every (or any) time step in a PyClaw simulation.  We'll write a `before_step` function that changes the boundary conditions to be periodic after the initial wave is generated."
