Multiple regions can be specified, and this can be used in conjunction with flagging based on amplitude (whether a point is refined only to $L_1$ or to some higher level $\\leq L_2$ depends on the amplitude).  If a point lies in more than one region, the maximum of $L_1$ values and the maximum of the $L_2$ values for each region are used as limits.
